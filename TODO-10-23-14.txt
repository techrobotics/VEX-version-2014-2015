Here's what we need to do on 10/23/14:

1. Make sure the main arm angle can be acturrately measured above 90 degrees.
   We know that below 90 degrees, it's accurate.
   So do something like "while arm < 150, move up" and see if it actually goes 150 degrees

	-If it's not accurate, figure out how to make it accurate

	-When it's accurate, figure out how to limit the main arm to 160 degrees max

2. While some people figure out how to limit main arm, others test the autonomous.
   We have code that should go a specified distance in inches.

	-Put in circumference for the distance and see if the wheel moves just one rotation
 	   (there's tape on one of the wheels for this)

	-once that's accurate, enter in a distance and see if the robot actually goes that distance


That will probably take the entire time.

If we finish testing and writing the main arm limit, here's other stuff we should do:

1. Figure out autonomus turning (http://www.robotc.net/wiki/Tutorials/Arduino_Projects/Mobile_Robotics/VEX/Using_encoders_to_make_turns)

2. Add to the driving straight code so that it always goes straight (Spring should know what this means).
