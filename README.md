=====================

OA STEM Vex Robotics Code for 2014-15 season

=====================

SET UP Github:

These are good tutorials on how to set up the GitHub.

You should probably create your own repository and experiment with the tutorial

NOTE: When dealing with the actual code, don't worry about the Online Repository. We'll be using
"https://github.com/techrobotics/VEX-version-2014-2015"

=====================

SET UP ROBOTC CODE:

1. Make sure your account is configured and everything (do the stuff above).
2. Open Git Shell
3. Clone the repo by typing in "git clone https://github.com/techrobotics/VEX-version-2014-2015"
4. Type in "ls" and make sure you have all of the code.
5. If you have everything, you're done.


=====================

HOW TO GIT (Hopefully you had experience doing this by experimenting with the tutorial):

1. Make Changes
2. Make sure you're in the directory with the files (you should have [<Branch Name>] in blue or green)
3. Add the file(s) ("git add <file name>" OR "git add -A" to add all the files)
4. Commit changes (git commit -m "Put useful message here")
5. Push the changes onto the online repository (git push)


=====================

USEFUL COMMANDS TO NAVIGATE DIRECTORIES (folders):

    The tilde (~) symbol stands for your home directory. If you are user, then the tilde (~) stands for /home/user

    pwd: The pwd command will allow you to know in which directory you're located (pwd stands for "print working directory"). Example: "pwd" in the Desktop directory will show "~/Desktop". 

    ls: The ls command will show you ('list') the files in your current directory. Used with certain options, you can see sizes of files, when files were made, and permissions of files. Example: "ls ~" will show you the files that are in your home directory.

    cd: The cd command will allow you to change directories. When you open a terminal you will be in your home directory. To move around the file system you will use cd. Examples:

        To navigate into the root directory, use "cd /"

        To navigate to your home directory, use "cd" or "cd ~"

        To navigate up one directory level, use "cd .."

        To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use "cd -"

        To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, specify the full directory path that you want to go to. For example, use, "cd /var/www" to go directly to the /www subdirectory of /var/. As another example, "cd ~/Desktop" will move you to the Desktop subdirectory inside your home directory. 


    rmdir: The rmdir command will delete an empty directory. To delete a directory and all of its contents recursively, use rm -r instead.

    mkdir: The mkdir command will allow you to create directories. Example: "mkdir music" will create a directory called "music".
